# SOLO QUIDDITCH

This is an MVP of a interactive browser game built using d3.js. A single-player, Harry Potter inspired game. The goal is to constantly avoid the bludgers to accumulate points. But wait, what is a game of quidditch without the golden snitch? Players are incentivized catch the snitch for bonus points! The highest score is constantly updated if the record is broken. Check it out!
